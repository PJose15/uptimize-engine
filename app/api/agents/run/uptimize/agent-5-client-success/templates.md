Hi {Name},

Since we already improved {metric/win} (from {before} to {after}),
can you give me 1-2 sentences on what changed and how it feels

I'll draft it and you can edit. Takes 30 seconds.

Want to capture this while it's fresh.

Thanks!

your approval.
```

### Follow-up (if no response after 3 days)

```
{Name} — totally understand if you're busy.

If you have 60 seconds, just reply with:

## H) Exception SOP (Handling Edge Cases)

```
EXCEPTION HANDLING SOP

When a workflow encounters an exception:

1. CAPTURE
   - Log exception in ticketing system
   - Tag with exception type (from exception library)
   - Capture context: inputs, workflow state, timestamp
   - Screenshot/logs if available

2. IMMEDIATE HANDLING
   - Check exception library for documented handling procedure
   - Follow fallback mode if defined
   - Escalate to human if:
     * No documented procedure exists
     * Fallback mode failed
     * Client-specific edge case

3. RESOLUTION
   - Execute resolution steps
   - Verify outcome
   - Document what was done
   - Update client

4. PREVENTION ANALYSIS
   - Is this a new exception type?
     → Add to exception library
     → Consider if it should be automated
   - Is this a known exception?
     → Review frequency (is it increasing?)
     → Consider if current handling is optimal

5. OPTIMIZATION DECISION
   For recurring exceptions (3+ times/month):
   - Create Change Request to automate handling
   - Estimate impact vs effort
   - Add to optimization backlog
   - Discuss in next strategy review

6. AUDIT TRAIL
   Every exception must create audit event with:
   - Exception type
   - Trigger/cause
   - Handling steps taken
   - Resolution status
   - Time to resolution
   - Who handled it (system/agent/human)
```
